* background
read linearly no problem... until MutationObserver
harder than it should to understand

* what makes it hard to understand
=>explanation of config harder than it should
-characterdata = ?
 never explained clearly what "characterData" is
 not clear it is a text node as explained in https://javascript.info/dom-nodes => (add link and acnhor?)
-some options only apply if one or multiple other options exist
-not clear that the value must be true/false

=>should separate the register (observe) from the callback part
(put observe example nearer to the observe explanation)
(put callback explanation afterwards?)
